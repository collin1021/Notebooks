    "The importance of materials throughout history is so large that even certain periods of history have been named after the ages in which they are developed/used (i.e. Stone Age, Bronze Age, Plastic Age, etc.). It would seen that currently we are in the composite stage as fiber-composite materials can be seen in use from boat hulls to golf rods. The purpose of Barbero's book is to give the reader the tools to design and use composites for any application.\n",
